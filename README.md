 - This project can be seen at my github profile linked below.
 - It was easy to do since I already had practice with css and html.
 - I improved the use of images in my projects and the use of media queries for a responsive design.
 - I'm proud that I was able to code the page quicker than I thought.

### Built With

I built it with pure html and css
